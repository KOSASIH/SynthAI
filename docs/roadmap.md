# SynthAI Roadmap

## Overview

The SynthAI roadmap outlines the planned features and improvements for the SynthAI system. The roadmap is divided into short-term and long-term goals.

### Short-Term Goals

Improve the data generation component to support more complex data types and distributions.
Add support for additional machine learning algorithms in the model training component.
Improve the model evaluation component to support more advanced evaluation metrics.
Improve the API documentation and add more examples.

### Long-Term Goals

Add support for distributed training of machine learning models.
Add support for real-time data generation and model training.
Integrate the SynthAI system with other machine learning platforms and tools.
Expand the SynthAI system to support additional problem domains, such as natural language processing and computer vision.
