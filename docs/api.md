# SynthAI API

## Overview

The SynthAI API provides a set of endpoints for generating synthetic data and training machine learning models. The API is designed to be easy to use and flexible, allowing users to customize the data generation and model training processes to their specific needs.

## 1. Data Generation Endpoints

The following endpoints are available for generating synthetic data:
```
/data/generate: Generates synthetic data based on user-defined parameters.
/data/preprocess: Preprocesses collected data to remove any inconsistencies or errors.
/data/augment: Applies various data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of the synthetic data.
```

## 2. Model Training Endpoints

The following endpoints are available for training machine learning models:
```
/models/train: Trains machine learning models on the synthetic data.
/models/evaluate: Evaluates the performance of the trained models on a separate testing set.
```

## 3. Authentication

The SynthAI API uses token-based authentication. To access the API, users must first obtain a token by authenticating with their username and password. The token can then be used to authenticate subsequent API requests.
