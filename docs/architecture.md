# SynthAI Architecture

## Overview

The SynthAI system is designed to generate synthetic data for machine learning applications. The system consists of three main components:

- Data Generation: This component is responsible for generating synthetic data based on user-defined parameters.
- Model Training: This component is responsible for training machine learning models on the synthetic data.
- Model Evaluation: This component is responsible for evaluating the performance of the trained models.

### Data Generation

The data generation component uses a combination of domain-specific knowledge and machine learning techniques to generate synthetic data. The data generation process consists of the following steps:

- Data Collection: The system collects data from various sources, including public datasets, APIs, and web scraping.
- Data Preprocessing: The system preprocesses the collected data to remove any inconsistencies or errors.
- Data Augmentation: The system applies various data augmentation techniques, such as rotation, scaling, and flipping, to increase the diversity of the synthetic data.
- Data Generation: The system generates synthetic data based on user-defined parameters, such as the number of samples, the distribution of the data, and the complexity of the data.

### Model Training

The model training component uses various machine learning algorithms to train models on the synthetic data. The model training process consists of the following steps:

- Data Preparation: The system prepares the synthetic data for training by splitting it into training, validation, and testing sets.
- Model Selection: The system selects the appropriate machine learning algorithm based on the problem domain and the synthetic data.
- Model Training: The system trains the selected model on the synthetic data.
- Model Evaluation: The system evaluates the performance of the trained model on a separate testing set.

### Model Evaluation

The model evaluation component uses various metrics to evaluate the performance of the trained models. The model evaluation process consists of the following steps:

- Model Selection: The system selects the trained models to be evaluated.
- Metric Selection: The system selects the appropriate evaluation metrics based on the problem domain and the trained models.
- Model Evaluation: The system evaluates the performance of the trained models using the selected evaluation metrics.
