# SynthAI Design

## Overview

The SynthAI system is designed to be modular, scalable, and extensible. The system is built using a microservices architecture, with each component running as a separate service. This allows for easy scaling and maintenance of the system.

### 1. Data Generation

The data generation component is implemented as a separate service that can be scaled independently of the other components. The service is implemented using Python and uses various data generation libraries, such as NumPy and Pandas, to generate synthetic data.

### 2. Model Training

The model training component is implemented as a separate service that can be scaled independently of the other components. The service is implemented using Python and uses various machine learning libraries, such as Scikit-learn and TensorFlow, to train machine learning models.

### 3. Model Evaluation

The model evaluation component is implemented as a separate service that can be scaled independently of the other components. The service is implemented using Python and uses various evaluation libraries, such as Scikit-learnand Matplotlib, to evaluate the performance of the trained models.

### 4. API

The SynthAI API is implemented as a separate service that exposes the functionality of the SynthAI system to external users. The API is implemented using Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python.
